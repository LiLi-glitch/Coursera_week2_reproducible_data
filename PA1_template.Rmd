#Loading and preprocessing the data
Show any code that is needed to

    Load the data (i.e. read.csv())

    Process/transform the data (if necessary) into a format suitable for your analysis
    
```{r}
library(readxl)
library(data.table)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
#read in csv 
activity <-fread("./activity.csv")
```

#What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
Calculate the total number of steps taken per day
```{r histogram total steps per day}
#calculate mean steps per day by aggregating
totalstepsday <-  aggregate(steps ~ date, activity, FUN = sum)

#make a histogram
ggplot(totalstepsday, aes(x=steps)) +
geom_histogram()



```

```{r}

#calculate mean steps per day by summarize
totalstepsday %>% summarize(mean(steps))

```

```{r}

#calculate median steps per day by summarize
totalstepsday %>% summarize(median(steps))
```

#What is the average daily activity pattern?

```{r time series mean steps 5 minute interval na}
library(lubridate)

#Make a time series plot (i.e. type = "l"\color{red}{\verb|type = "l"|}type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)
meansteps<- activity %>%
  group_by(interval) %>%

```{r}
#Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?
meansteps %>% subset(meansteps == max(meansteps))
```

#Imputing missing values

Note that there are a number of days/intervals where there are missing values (coded as NA\color{red}{\verb|NA|}NA). The presence of missing days may introduce bias into some calculations or summaries of the data.

```{r}
#Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with NA\color{red}{\verb|NA|}NAs)
summary(is.na(activity$steps))
#2304
```
```{r}
#Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use the mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc.

#use mean of the day divided by the total of intervals
activity <- activity %>%
  ungroup()%>%
  mutate(steps_day = as.numeric(mean(steps, na.rm=TRUE))) %>%
    group_by(date) %>%
         mutate(interval_n = as.numeric(n())) %>% 
mutate(steps_imp = dplyr::case_when(
  is.na(steps)== FALSE ~ as.numeric(steps),
  is.na(steps)== TRUE ~ steps_day/interval_n))

head(activity)
```
```{r}
#Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.
activity_2 <- activity %>%
  select(steps_imp, date, interval) %>%
  rename(steps = steps_imp)

summary(is.na(activity_2$steps))
```

```{r total steps per day imputed}
#Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day. Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment? What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?

#calculate mean steps per day by aggregating
totalstepsday_2 <-  aggregate(steps ~ date, activity_2, FUN = sum)

#make a histogram
ggplot(totalstepsday, aes(x=steps)) +

```

#before it was much higher

```

#median(steps)
#10765	
#not that different, the median is not too much influenced
